    <p>
        &emsp;Wistar Artists' Colony is a cutting-edge concept in the realm of artists' fellowships.
    Located in a beautiful apartment in Columbus, Ohio, Wistar Artists' Colony operates in a
    state-of-the-art, four-story art studio. The Colony is kept fully stocked with necessities
    and artmaking materials; the artists are entirely provided for by the generosity of donors and
    the Wistar Executive Board.</br>
</br>
    &emsp;Our artists enjoy several luxurious amenities while in residence. A gourmet cafeteria and 
    swimming pool are always available to residents. During their down time, our artists can 
    be found resting in the privacy room, or on one of many plush hammocks. Artists partnered with us
    also enjoy excursions to the surrounding apartment, where they can dash across the plush
    carpet and leap about the furniture. </br>
</br>
    &emsp; Artists participating in the Wistar colony agree to be constantly available to be viewed 
    by anyone who wishes to see them; a live video feed is available for public viewing
    at all hours. </br>
</br>
    &emsp;Wistar Artists' Colony operates on a strictly communal basis. While one artist may
    spearhead the concept of a particular work, each collaborator has an equal ability
    to participate and shape the artwork to their own will. What is formed from these
    collaborations and conflicts is the core of our creative process.</br>
</br>
    &emsp; The Colony currently accepts a maximum of six <i>Rattus</i> species artists. We are not
    currently accepting applications for artists of <i>Homo</i> species due to size contraints.</br>
</br></p>
    <h3> MISSION STATEMENT</h3>

    <p>&emsp; To promote radical unity through living, learning, and artmaking.</br></br></br>
    &emsp; To blur the traditional barriers of species roles.</br></br></br>
    &emsp; To amplify the voices of the unsung, marginalized, and vilified. </br></br></br>
    &emsp; To unashamedly push the boundaries of social propriety.</br></br></br>
    &emsp; To be transparent in intention and practice to our audience in every aspect possible.</br></br>
