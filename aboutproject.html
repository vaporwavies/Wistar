    <p style= "padding-right: 50%;"> &emsp;Wistar Artists' Colony is my final undergraduate project for Ohio State University's 
    Art and Technology Program. Planning was initiated in January 2021, and it first 
    went live on [INSERT DATE].</br></br>
    &emsp;This work began with the question of "how can I elevate the voices of the animals
    in my care to a level that is greater than my own?" I wanted to take a back seat to
    their will and whims; they needed proper credit for the inspiration they provide me.</br></br>
    &emsp;The initial working-title was "Rattopia." A little wonderland for my critters to
    enjoy, and for everyone else to enjoy viewing. I began with the two large tubs
    that comprise the middle of the enclosure, and added each new room piece by piece.
    Observing them interact with their
    environment was stirring; they meticulously arrange the objects I put down, never
    satisfied with anything's initial arrangement. They're particular about their space,
    and they constantly assert creative authority over it.</br></br>
    &emsp; From this, I developed the angle of the "artist's residence," where I fade into 
    the background and allow the rats to assume creative agency over the project. While 
    this arragement is ultimately fictional, as all of their work is interpreted and
    processed through my human, inherently fiction-generating brain; yet, other human
    brains tend to accept this and assign full credit to the rats.</br></br>
    &emsp; This project was done in entirely in collaboration with my four male rats who occupy
    the enclosure and play the roles of the artists. Each decision had to be considered
    with their desires in mind; if their peculiarities aren't carefully considered enough,
    it's not unlikely that I'd find my hard work torn to shreds. Yet, at the same time, I had
    to keep in mind that what my brain automatically classfied as destructive could be 
    percieved as creative to them.</br></br>
    &emsp; They also have specific material
    considerations; plastic or styrofoam is likely to cause impaction if accidentally
    ingested, but paper and cardboard are likely to be harmlessly passed through the body. Therefore,
    all materials that the rats are meant to manipulate and alter need to be paper or wood-based,
    while all materials that are not meant to be altered need to be ceramic or metal, as both
    are fairly impervious to chewing. </br></br>
    &emsp; Rats are emphemeral creatures; the extremely lucky ones live to four years old, while 
    most only get two or three. Yet, these little lives are full of incredible richness and vivacity;
    I'm so grateful that I get to witness them with you.
