    <h4>Gnawings I</h4>
        <p>paper and honey. 3”H x 3” W x 3”D. 2021</p> 
        <p>from Frank:<br>
            <br>
             "I believe this to be one of my best works. Each sheet was coated in
        golden raw honey, creating my ideal of a sculptural blank canvas. The feast that resulted
        produced this stirring work of abstraction."
        </p>
    <h4>Scraps of Freedom</h4>
        <p>plastic in glass container. 5”H x 2”W x 2”D. 2021</p>
        <p>from Jones: <br>
            <br>
            "When they said I'd have to be contained for most of the day, I laughed.
        Those who think they can restrain me are bound to be surprised. I come and go when I want.
        This work is proof of that."

    <h4>Gymprints</h4>
        <p>oven-bake clay and tempera paint. 3”H x 5”W x 7”D. 2021</p>
        <p>from Crunchy:<br>
            <br>
             "paint tastes. bad </br>
            i didn't like this one"
        </p> <br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h4>Berries Triptych</h4>
        <p>tempera paint on canvas. </p>
        <p>from Nico: <br>
            <br>
            "Blue paint did stain my pinkish feet.<br>
        I put up with it, as I got a treat. <br>
        The canvas is stained with red and blue.<br>
        Look very close, and you may see the poo."
