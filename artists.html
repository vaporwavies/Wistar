    Frank
    I adhere to the philosophy of delicious creation.
    What inspires me cannot be faked. Without this blood of inspiration flowing through my veins, 
    I can seldom summon the energy to move. Yet, this is the beauty of delicious creation; a daily 
    necessity is transformed into a divine instrument.
    What goes into me is artwork; what comes out of me is artwork. Delicious creation is a beautiful circle of life.


    Jones
    I used to be known as a tough character. It served me well for a while; establishing hard boundaries is a necessity when you’re around the kind of folks I grew up with. Yet, eventually I found myself pounded out into the smooth mold of society; I guess I came here to see if I could get some of my rough edges back.
    I push boundaries. I refuse to be restrained by arbitrary limitations. Some people find me too rough. Too crass. Too real. 
    I found the line between creation and destruction and I gnawed it to shreds.
    I’ll bite your toes. Why don’t you bite mine.
